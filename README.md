# twb Spellchecker
This is a tkinter based app run in python that will take in a .twb file and spell check it for errors. If errors are found it will give you the option to correct them and write back to the file. If you have .twbx files you can unzip them and use it on the underlying .twb that is contained inside.

The app uses the pyspellchecker library for checking spelling errors which should be pip installed before running.
